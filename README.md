# 🏨 Mock Hotel DBMS

This repository contains a **school project** developed to practice and demonstrate skills in **SQL** and **relational database design**. The system simulates a basic **Hotel Database Management System**, including guests, bookings, rooms, employees, and other key entities you’d expect in a hotel environment.

## 📚 Project Purpose

This project was part of coursework focused on learning and applying:

- Relational database design principles
- SQL query writing (DML & DDL)
- Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling
- Normalization and data integrity
- Real-world schema modeling

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Oracle Database 11g** – For the actual database implementation
- **Oracle SQL Developer** – For writing and running SQL queries, managing tables, and interacting with the database

## 🗃️ Features

- Creation of tables with primary and foreign key constraints
- Insert statements to populate the schema with sample data
- SQL queries to retrieve relevant data for hotel operations
- Demonstrations of joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions
